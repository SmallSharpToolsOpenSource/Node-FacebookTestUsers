### Facebook Test Users

This script generates 10 test users for your Facebook app. 
It is a 0.0.1 release and requires you to adjust the script
to include your App ID and Access Token. A later version
could read these values from a local configuration or
even your local key store.

# Usage

Update app.js with your App ID and App Access Token.
Run `createtestusers.sh` and wait for the list to
be logged to the console.
